Dear whoever has this game right now,
I have started a "devlog", where changes of the game can be written, that way
we know what was changed during the last holder, it could also potentially help
with bugfixing, who knows? Well just look into the devlog.txt for what it looks
like atm, well thats all from me, toodles!
