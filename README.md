# Project Dark Rising 3

Based on Essentials v18. This is a fork of the following repository: https://github.com/Maruno17/pokemon-essentials

This repository is DEPRECATED, but the project is still ongoing. For more information about the current state of the game, visit the website: https://darkrisingfans.weebly.com/dark-rising-iii.html

## About

This repository contains the final version of the scripts and data files used in the Pokémon Dark Rising 3 fangame. It was initially set to private during development of the game to prevent accidental leaks of the story and new gameplay features, but that is no longer a concern because the game will not be moving forward as a fangame (and as such, will not be using any of the resources available in this repository). The full repository with all resources will be available as its own project listing in other forums.
